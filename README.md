<h2>Turing Machine and Knapsack Problem</h2>
- ðŸ’¬ About this repo: In the second year of my studies at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at Ovidius University in Constanta, in the computer science program, I studied a subject called "Computability and Complexity." In this course, I developed a Turing machine and implemented the Knapsack problem, using Eclipse as the integrated development environment (IDE).
